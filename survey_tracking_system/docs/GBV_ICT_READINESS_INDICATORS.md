```
Total Score = Σ (Domain Score × Domain Weight)
```

| 80-100 | **High Readiness** | Institution has strong GBV ICT capacity |
| 60-79 | **Moderate Readiness** | Basic capacity exists, improvements needed |
| 40-59 | **Low Readiness** | Significant gaps in GBV ICT capacity |

The KoBoToolbox survey form is structured in sections matching the 10 domains above. Each section contains:

1. **Skip logic** - Questions appear based on previous answers
2. **Validation rules** - Ensures data quality
3. **GPS capture** - Records institution location
4. **Photo capture** - Evidence of infrastructure (optional)

### Mapping KoBoToolbox Fields

The system automatically maps KoBoToolbox field names to database columns. Common field name variations are supported:

```python
# Example field mappings
"institution_name" → ["institution_name", "name_of_institution", "org_name"]
"region" → ["region", "region_name", "location/region"]
"has_gbv_policy" → ["has_gbv_policy", "gbv_policy_exists", "policy/gbv_policy"]
```

### Sync Process

1. Configure `KOBO_API_TOKEN` in environment
2. Set campaign's `kobo_asset_uid` to your form UID
3. Call `POST /api/campaigns/{id}/sync-kobo` to import data
4. System creates/updates institutions, surveys, and readiness data
5. Readiness scores are automatically calculated
